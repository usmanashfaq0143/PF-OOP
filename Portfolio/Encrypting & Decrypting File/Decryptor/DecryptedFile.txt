First of all if u have already read the code so just stop wasting time if u have little knowledge then u already know the answer But i THINK either u haven't read the code or u are not that genius.\n 2. Ha. so This Game is that it will generate random number from 0 to 65 don't know can be any number so just put your guesses.\n 3. Now Good things: There are HINTS for u at specific place of time so KEEP PATIENCE You WIll Loose.\n 4. Although i have Tried my best to Give u the Wining Reward it cost me a lot of time to make so Try if u Fail First Time Its Part of the Game and LIFE. \n 5.
